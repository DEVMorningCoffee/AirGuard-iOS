Trackers are for example the Apple AirTag, Samsung SmartTag and Tile Mate. We want to evaluate how well we can protect people from being tracked with our app.

You can use the app without participating in the study. If you participate, the following conditions apply:

**Data collected**
• Information about the devices found, such as the type of device, signal strength, and date and time.
• We log when the app sends you a notification, the date and time of it

Information shared voluntarily
• Age, gender and location (country, state)
• Locations where you found a tracker.

**Duration of the study**
• As long as you have installed the app and want to participate in the study.
• You can stop participating at any time in the settings.

**Deletion of data**
You can request deletion of your data by email. To do so, they need to copy your ID for identification from the app and provide it to us. We can then delete the data set associated with you.

**Data processing**
All data is treated confidentially and stored on servers of the TU Darmstadt. No other persons outside of SEEMOO at TU Darmstadt will have access. An identification of the individual participants is not possible. There are no risks associated with participation. The data processing of this study is carried out according to the data protection regulations of the German Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) and the Hessian Data Protection and Freedom of Information Act (HDSIG). The data will be used exclusively for the purposes described in the informed consent form.

If you participate in the study, you confirm that you are older than 18 years of age and have read this consent form.

To protect you against such an attack, AirGuard uses Bluetooth to scan for nearby trackers. The app uses your location to detect if a tracker moves with you.\n\nIf AirGuard detects a suspicious tracker, you will receive a notification with more detailed information.";

Also make sure you don't move to another location until you disabled it. You can try to make a complaint to the police. Authorities might be able to determine the owner of the tracker using its serial number.";

If you are curious what's around you, you can use this feature. But please keep in mind that it is currently not possible to see if a tracker is connected to its owner or not. Thus, you might see your own or friends' trackers.\n\nAlso, it's important to know that some trackers randomly change their identity (Bluetooth MAC address) a couple of times a day. As a result, one tracker could be displayed multiple times in the app. That's because it's often not possible to match the different, randomized identities.";

**Samsung SmartTags**
These tags are made by Samsung and work almost the same as AirTags.

*Background detection*: ✅
*Automatic alert on tracking* ✅
*Manual scanning* ✅

**Tile Tracker**
Tile is a company that exclusively makes Bluetooth trackers. These also have similar features to AirTags.

*Background detection* ✅
*Automatic alert on tracking* ✅
*Manual scanning* ✅

**Chipolo Tracker (without Find My)**
Chipolo offers Find My trackers that only work with iPhones and trackers that also work with Android devices. Here we cover the trackers that are also compatible with Android phones.
Chipolo trackers can be found in the background, but iOS cannot tell if they are following you or not. If you see one, it's worth doing a manual scan.

*Detection in the background* ✅
*Automatic warning when following* ✅
*Manual scan* ✅

**AirTags**
AirTags are Apple's trackers. As a result, they are only detectable to a limited extent, as many signals are filtered by the system. In the manual scan we can find AirTags and you can locate them. Tracking detection in the background is already provided by the Apple Find My App.

*Background detection* ❌
*Automatic alert on tracking* ❌
*Manual scanning* ✅

**Find My Tracker**
These are trackers that are compatible with Apple's Find My, but come from other manufacturers. There are a few manufacturers that make such trackers: Chipolo, Pebblebee, Atuvos, etc. As with AirTags, the tracker cannot be detected in the background. Again, the Find My app automatically warns you.

*Detection in the background* ❌
*Automatic warning when tracking* ❌
